Gerard Daxault of [[House Daxault]] is the head of a truly massive fleet, rivalled only by the Imperial Navy. His fleet is primarily used as merchant ships, transporting goods across Wildspace. However, the fleet is very militarily capable, and acts as privateers on the side. Gerard himself is one of the best ship commanders on the Rock, capable of outmaneuvering nearly anyone. He is not afraid of making his skill known, being quite boisterous. He would come off as rude if his claims weren't backed up by reality. Few can match him in a duel, either. [[Prince Aric Calar]] has challenged him many times, losing each time, but by smaller and smaller margins. Gerard sees Aric as something of an adoptive son, although he knows the relationship is one-sided.
