Head of [[House Ellodan]], Kiade Ellodan is a young and hot-headed elf whose family earned their wealth through real estate management. Kiade is an avid capitalist who can often be found speculating in imports to Bral. He attempts to dress in the latest fashion, though always seems to be a week or so late to the party. He is close with [[Basa Lianin]], although their relationship has yet to be made public. He is quite self-conscious.
