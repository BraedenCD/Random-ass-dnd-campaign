The Bralian Shakespeare, Kiria Evensong is the owner and director of the [[Royal Theatrical Company]], the oldest theater on the Rock. Her plays are always a hit, and bring her and the Company tremendous amounts of wealth that she uses to fund future plays and expand the theater. She rarely acts, but when she does, she utterly steals the show. She is also the Juggler, one of the Underbarons. As the Juggler, she runs the [[Juggler's Folk Guildhouse]] in the Middle City, where she puts on lower-brow comedies on a tight budget that remain revolutionary. However... this is just a front for the Juggler's Men, a group of dangerous thieves who merely use the theater as a disguise. Many attendees of the theater have found their most valuable belongings go missing as soon as they leave the theater, only to find them in the Lost and Found, where lost items are returned at a price. Those who get close to realizing the truth are often brutally murdered. Kiria was initially just another member of the group, but eventually developed a passion for the stage itself, beyond the front. She is a playwright in the purest form. [[Prince Andru]] is something of a fan of her works, but she knows that he knows about her double life and she is curious as to why he doesn't out her. Due to this, she trusts him deeply.
