Morgan Kullek is the head of [[House Kullek]] and the self-declared "arch-rival" of [[Gerard Daxault]]. The relationship does not go both ways. His body is gradually withering due to age, but his mind remains incredibly sharp. He tends to wear outfits of all black. His fleet is comparable of that of [[House Daxault]], but not as well-armed. He hides his mind behind a veneer of insufferability. He despises [[Prince Andru]] for his attempts to reinvent the government of Bral, preferring things as they are (where he has power). He is never seen without a squad of bodyguards escorting him. A single attempt has been made against his life, 60 years ago, and he has taken that to heart.
