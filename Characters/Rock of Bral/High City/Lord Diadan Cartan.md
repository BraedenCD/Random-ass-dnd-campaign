Lord Diadan Cartan of [[House Cartan]] is the closest friend and confidant of [[Prince Andru]]. He seeks to remain in power for as long as possible by exploiting the young prince's unwillingness to act. His end goal is to attain lichdom and assume the prince's power upon his death, using the souls of the people of Bral to extend his life indefinitely. Many nobles distrust him, but none can find definitive evidence of his plans. Some theorize that he has some kind of connection with the lichgod Vecna. He is a tall man with a well-built body and piercing eyes. He cares not for those who seek council with the prince, and will vehemently turn them away.
