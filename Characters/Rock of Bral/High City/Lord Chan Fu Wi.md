An old man well past his prime, Lord Chan Fu Wi is still a formidable combatant. The most influential member of the Shou clan, Chan wields great political power. He commands respect wherever he goes. A pair of bodyguards have been assigned to follow him wherever he goes, despite his requests for them to leave him alone. He oversees diplomatic emissaries to Bral, granting them refuge.
