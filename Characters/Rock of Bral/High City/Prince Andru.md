Prince Andru is not a god. Well, that's what he tells himself. Ask anyone else, and they'd likely tell you otherwise. Deified by the people and worshipped en masse, Andru resides in his [[Royal Palace]], called Starhaven by Bralians, and rarely leaves. This is not because he thinks of himself as better than the common person, but rather because he worries that interfering in the lives of his citizens and solving their problems for them might make them dependent on him. His power comes from a combination of incredibly advanced magitech and divine heritage. His mother was a solar, though no one would find out until years after Andru was born. He knows of [[Lord Diadan Cartan|Diadan Cartan]]'s plans, but also knows that, eventually, a great hero will rise to halt his plans. That is the crux of his belief system. Every action has an equal and opposite reaction. Every evil king will have a brave warrior depose them. Every cruel dragon will be brought to heel by a group of adventurers. He came to this conclusion after a long conversation with [[Large Luigi]] of [[The Happy Beholder]]. The contents of this conversation are not known, but the government of Bral has been permanently altered ever since. Nowadays, his very presence is a force of personality. It is very difficult to disagree with him on any subject, not because of any magic, but purely because he is so persuasive. His hair radiates a golden light, his skin is unblemished, his physique is unparalleled. Despite all of this, his voice sounds as meek and self-conscious as a shy adolescent.
