Princess Ellana Cozar, widow of the late Prince Will Calar, who was killed during the Great Battle, is a human woman in her early 50s. Her son, [[Prince Aric Calar]], lives with her in [[House Calar]]. She keeps to herself and lives a quiet life. She receives few visitors, but is more than glad to make those who do visit feel at home. Her days are spent gazing out over the Trailing Edge into the Astral Sea, searching for meaning. She has taken up writing short stories, which often find their way into the Bralian Gazette, but lacks confidence in her authorial abilities.
