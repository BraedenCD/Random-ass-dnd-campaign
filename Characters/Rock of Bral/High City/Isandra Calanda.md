Isandra Calanda is the heir and only surviving member of [[House Calanda]]. Still ludicrously wealthy, but her fortune is gradually being spent on extravagant parties and soirees reserved for the uber-wealthy. The biggest names on the Rock attend, including [[Prince Andru]] himself. However, when not in the spotlight, she lives a different life. The most accomplished cat burglar in Bral, she steals things from nobles that she thinks they'll never notice missing. Unfortunately, sometimes they do notice, at which point Isandra relies on her friends at the [[Illithid Embassy]]. It is not known how she made connections with the mind flayers, but she supports them in exchange for them lobotomizing those she sees as threats to her way of life, all under the nose of the other nobles. [[High Magistrate Donobar|The High Magistrate]] is aware of her dealings, but cautious of the consequences of revealing them. She has a warm and very jovial personality, and appears to be in her late 20s.
