Prince Aric Calar, only son of [[Princess Ellana Cozar]] and the late Prince Will Calar, took his father's death harder than his mother did. He is in his early 20s, but he looks about 40. He spends his time wandering the Rock, looking for someone to challenge his skill as a marksman. Aric is excellent, but many do surpass him. When this happens, he returns to [[House Calar]] to sulk, often for several days. He constantly strives to be better than he is in all aspects. He often comes off as cold, but cares deeply. Perhaps too deeply.
