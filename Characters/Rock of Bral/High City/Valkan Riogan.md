A fallen paladin of great renown, Valkan Riogan is one of the more unique faces among the nobles of Bral. He left Faerun and took to Wildspace after the love of his life was murdered, forsaking his oath in the process. He meandered for years until he came upon the Rock, where he found [[Prince Andru]] and swore a new oath, to protect Bral at all costs. He doesn't often speak about his past. He is the proud owner of the mercenary company [[Valkan's Legion]], home to the most prestigious mercs on the Rock. They are completely loyal to Valkan in every aspect, and strive to do good as often as possible... though a little extra coin never hurt anyone. He is among the most selfless of the nobles on Bral. He is in his late 30s and has a very well-worn appearance.

| Multiattack. The knight makes three Sunspear attacks.<br><br>Spellcasting. The knight casts one of the following spells, using Charisma as the spellcasting ability (spell save DC 15):<br><br>- 1/day each: [Greater Restoration](https://5e.tools/spells.html#greater%20restoration_phb), [Sending](https://5e.tools/spells.html#sending_phb), [Word of Recall](https://5e.tools/spells.html#word%20of%20recall_phb) (the prepared sanctuary is the Solar Bastion)<br>    <br><br>Sunspear. _Melee or Ranged Spell Attack:_ +8 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 120 ft., one target. _Hit:_ 14 (3d6 + 4) radiant damage, or 21 (5d6 + 4) radiant damage if the target is a Fiend or an Undead.<br><br>Solar Flare (Recharge 5–6). The knight unleashes a blaze of brilliant energy that fills a 30-foot-radius sphere centered on the knight. Each creature of the knight's choice in that area must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 22 (4d10) radiant damage and has the [blinded](https://5e.tools/conditionsdiseases.html#blinded_phb) condition until the end of its next turn. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage only. For the next minute, the affected area is filled with bright light that is sunlight. |
