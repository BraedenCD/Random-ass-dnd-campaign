Ozamata is the head of [[Locations/Rock of Bral/Low City/House Murawa|House Murawa]], one of the most powerful trading houses in Bral. His fortune is made through the exchange of luxury goods, such as silk and spice. His place on the [[Council of Captains]] has been attained through decades of effort, and he is not afraid to make it known. While he has rightfully earned his place as a Bralian noble, he is also the leader of [[Yakuza House|a criminal organization in the Low City]]. He rules over the criminal underworld with an iron fist, although he has proven to be incredibly compassionate for those suffering unnecessarily. He is a middle-aged man, relatively short. He always keeps his word.
