[[High Magistrate]] Lord Michel Donobar is an elderly man with an aging body but a mind with encyclopedic knowledge of the happenings of Bral. Despite his masterful skill in handling matters of state, he is often spoken over and disregarded during council meetings, being seen as a senile old man. His network of spies spans the Rock, having infiltrated every major faction. A politician who knows anything about anything will assume that they are always being watched by one of Donobar's agents. Many assassination attempts have been made against his life, but none have succeeded. Bullets miss by a centimeter, poisons are given to the person in the next seat over. He now struggles to speak due to his old age, preferring to use a text-to-speech machine that he brings with him at all times. He wants to help preserve the future of Bral in any way possible, even if that means working with morally ambiguous individuals.
