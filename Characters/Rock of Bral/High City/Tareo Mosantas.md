As opposed to [[Basa Lianin]], the philanthropy of Tareo of [[House Mosantas]] is motivated by selflessness alone. His singular mission in life is to improve the lives of others, which he does quite well by providing funding to many reform movements seeking to improve the Bralian government. He has also been known to hunt down criminals himself, which has brought him in conflict with practically every criminal organization on the Rock. The only reason he manages to stay alive is his superhuman reflexes, theorized to come from the amulet hanging around his neck. His family descends from some of the most vicious pirates in Bral's early days, but have long since reformed and assimilated into the rest of Bralian society.
