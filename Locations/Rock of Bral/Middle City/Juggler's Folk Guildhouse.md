Hidden by the facade of a small backstreet playhouse, the guild of thieves known as the Juggler’s Men actually doubles as an acting company and puts on bawdy comedies here to maintain their disguise. It is so successful that no one has ever discovered the location of their guildhouse, let alone the identities of the actors and performers who comprise its membership. The Juggler’s Men prefer to earn their living from the wealthy, but they have been known to brutally murder any person who comes too close to discovering them. It is entirely possible that an enthusiast of the theater might patronize this company for years and never suspect that they were anything else except an assortment of raggle-taggle actors, clowns, and acrobats.
