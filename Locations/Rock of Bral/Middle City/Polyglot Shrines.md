This building is dedicated to all the deities of one pantheon. The DM can introduce his own pantheon here, or select an appropriate one. If you are stumped, the Chinese pantheon with a Shou congregation would work well, possibly with a couple of name changes. The polyglot shrine includes small altars or sanctums for each of the major dei¬ ties of the pantheon, as well as common areas dedicated to the pantheon as a whole. The priests of the polyglot pantheon will look favorably on any character who already worships one of the deities included in the mythos. Again, it may be difficult for a PC priest to take advantage of this, as the polyglots show equal respect to their own patron deity and their deity’s worst rivals. For example, a priest of Athena should be angered to hear Ares and Aphrodite mentioned in the same breath as the goddess of wisdom. In general, you should feel free to use this area to bring an important mythos of your campaign to the Rock. If your campaign is truly space-based, you can make the polyglot faith available as a choice of deity for a PC priest. Generally, the polyglots are rarely encountered in a sphere where none of their deities are recognized.
