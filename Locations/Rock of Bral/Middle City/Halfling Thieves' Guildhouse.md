Taking the form of a large mercery on the outside, the interior of this building is the guild hall for the halfling thieves’ guild and the center of operations for the halfling Cinderbaron Meredin Sandyfoot. Many people come here to buy bolts of silk or bales of cotton and never realize that only a few feet away small, silent watchers are observing their every move. While these halflings are the least violent and most benevolent of the Rock’s underworld groups, they are not stupid and they are quite able to defend themselves. Should any intruder be foolish enough to disregard their subtle warnings and invade the halfling hall, he will find himself in a deadly maze of traps and ambushes. The halflings have at least 10 secret exits from this building.
