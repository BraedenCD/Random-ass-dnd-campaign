These buildings are the barracks, offices, stables, and armories of the mercenary company known as Valkan’s Legion. Most of the legionnaires live elsewhere in the city when the company is between contracts. When the legion takes a job, they move into the barracks and begin rigorous recruiting and training programs. To hire the entire legion of five companies plus priestly and magical support would cost about 60,000 gp per month, plus transport and upkeep. High risk ventures can drastically increase the cost of employing them.
