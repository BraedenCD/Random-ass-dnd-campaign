One of the most famous small merchants of Bral is the archmage Gamalon Idogyr, a famed traveller and scholar. He collects and sells unusual magical items, favoring any item that assists the space traveller or the spelljammer. His store is usually well stocked with such items as rings of warmth, free action, jumping, or feather fall; wands of flame extinguishing or illumination; necklaces of adaption; boots of levitation; decanters of endless water; Murlynd’s spoons; and other mystic de¬ vices. There is a base 30% chance that any one of the above items is available, but exceptionally rare pieces may be reduced to 10%.  
 Gamalon is unusual in that the Arcane often deal with him and have taught him some of their spelljamming dweamorcraft. There are several rare items which only Gamalon offers, such as sails of maneuverability, rings of enhancement, or boots of starstriding. The DM is encouraged to de¬ velop these items if he wishes, or to keep them out of the players’ hands if he feels they are not strict¬ ly necessary. Gamalon’s home with its broad courtyard and several buildings, is behind his shop. He is a noble by virtue of land ownership, since he purchased the grounds of his home from the crown some years ago. Gamalon generally does not welcome visitors into his home, but he does enjoy a good story and the company of steady customers in his curio shop
