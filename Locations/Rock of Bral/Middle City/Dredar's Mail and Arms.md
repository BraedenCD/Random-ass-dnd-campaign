Dredar is a human merchant who does not make his own weaponry, but instead purchases arms and transports them here for sale. Dredar exacts a tidy profit on this, so any item in his store costs 20% more than the listed cost in the Player’s Handbook. However, his selection is unbeatable. He carries every standard weapon, as well as the (d6 + 2.) occasional exotic item, such as a magical shield or a sword with a silver blade. A small staff of well paid armorers and leather workers are maintained on the premises for fitting and tailoring. Moble fighters may be disappointed to learn that the heaviest armor commonly available in Wildspace is plate mail. Full or field plate is quite rare.
