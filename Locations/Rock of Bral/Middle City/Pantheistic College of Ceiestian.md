One of the more popular deities among space farers is Ceiestian, the Star Wanderer. The worship of Ceiestian spread from Greyspace about 300 years ago and now spans a half dozen spheres. (Bral can be in Greyspace or in one of the spheres to which Celestian’s worship has spread, whichever you prefer.) The priests of Ceiestian tout him as one of the chief patrons of spelljamming and enjoy a bitter rivalry with Ptah. The college of Ceiestian worships the deity in any form he chooses to take in other spheres, usually a good deity with the stars as his area of concern. One of the oldest buildings on the Rock, the temple of Ceiestian was built in the city’s piratical days. Even now, many captains stop here before setting sail, seeking his blessing. Ceiestian appears in the GREYHAWK® campaign setting. He is a wandering deity who was drawn to the stars and the astral plane, roaming the wondrous depths of space. The Star Wanderer is revered by astronomers, astrologers, philosophers, navigators, and dreamers and poets. His symbol is a circle of seven stars.
