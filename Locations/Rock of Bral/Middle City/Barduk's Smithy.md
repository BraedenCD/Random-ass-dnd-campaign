A rambling, open craftsman’s shop and forge, Barduk’s Smithy features a goldsmith, a silversmith, a pewtersmith, several blacksmiths, and one or two bladesmiths and armorers. Barduk herself is a stout dwarven matriarch with arms like tree trunks. She and her four sons do most of the smithing, having taken on several journeymen and apprentices for light work. Barduk’s husband fell in battle almost 45 years ago; since then, she has built her small home forge into a powerful business. Almost any metal goods can be had at Barduk’s for a fine price—usually 10-20% less than normal. Weapons, however, require a great deal more work and are at the usual price. Barduk is a sensible businesswoman, but she cannot tolerate the sight of elves—her husband was a pirate whose ship was destroyed by a Man O' War of the Imperial Navy.
