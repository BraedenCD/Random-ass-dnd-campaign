Perhaps the most beautiful place on the Rock is the elven district, commonly called the Forest. As the elven center of Bral, the Forest is a mystical grove of birch, laurel, ash and oak. Many of the trees are several hundred years old, which seems to contradict the known history of the Rock. There is a strange, silvery shadow beneath the eaves of the wood that seems to wall off the elven district as surely as any fence of iron. Few elves actually live in the Forest. Several dozen adventurous or mercantile types maintain fine townhouses in the city, but no visitor to the Forest has ever seen a dwelling inside the silver wood. Most Bralians assume that perhaps two or three dozen elves sleep and eat under the trees’ cloaking shadow, and the rest just drift in and out. In actuality, the Forest conceals a stronghold built deep into the Rock. Elegant panelled hall¬ ways and high, lamplit chambers wind deeply into the asteroid’s heart. Over 300 elves of the Imperial Navy live and work here, garrisoning the Rock as an outpost of the Armada. Very few non-elves have been here, and none without blindfolds. Less than a dozen humans in Bral suspect that there is more to the Forest than meets the eye. Elves in shining mail stand guard at the various entrances to the Forest, discouraging the curious from wandering into the elven retreat.
