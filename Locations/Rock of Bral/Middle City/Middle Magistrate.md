A small complex of connected buildings between Trader’s Way and the Great Market, the of fices of the Middle Magistrate are hardly as impressive as the High Magistrate’s building. However, they are far more active. The Middle Magistrate’s Watch patrols the streets sporadically, but they are frequently summoned to apprehend a criminal or intercede in a dispute. The Magistrate’s Watch in the Middle City consists of about 20 well-armed guardsmen with chainmail, long swords, and light crossbows. Several mages are available to assist in the apprehension of dangerous criminals. The Middle Magistrate herself is Lady Terissa Ketal, a hard and bitter human of 50 with a reputation as a “jettisoning judge.”  
 The buildings here include a courtroom, a watch barracks and office, and a small jail of six cells to hold dangerous criminals until they can be removed to a safer area.
