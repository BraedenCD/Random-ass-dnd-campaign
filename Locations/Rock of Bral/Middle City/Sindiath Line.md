The Sindiath Line, specializing in the operation of passenger liners, has only recently opened an office in Bral. In some spheres the company runs regular passenger service between large cities, but Bral is relatively isolated at times and the operation of a regular route is not profitable. The Sindiath instead charters small eelships and tradesmen to those passengers willing to pay. On occasion, a whaleship passes by Bral and runs a long route through some of the more common stops. The Bralian office owns and operates two tradesmen and two eels fitted out with passenger facilities. At any time, 0 to 3 are chartered out. Under no circumstances will the charter captains ever endanger their vessels.
