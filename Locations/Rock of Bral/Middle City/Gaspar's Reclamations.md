A shop stocking magical items and other rare and unusual treasures, Gaspar’s Reclamations occupies a fine position at the intersection of Grand Street and the Great Market. There is a 30% chance that any given magical item of 2,000 or less xp value is available for sale. The price is usually two to twelve times the xp value. There is a 5% chance that a magical item of 3,500 or less xp value is present and these are sold for five to twenty times their xp value. As a rule, five to twenty potions are available at any time, priced at twice their xp value. Anything else may or may not be in stock.
