Rising above the intersection of Grand Street and Sailmaker Street, this impressive building dominates the street. The Royal Exchequer exists to regulate the currency used in Bral. Many coinages, and most paper currencies, are simply not honored by the merchants of Bral. Visitors holding any of these currencies are left with the option of bartering goods without money, or of exchanging their money for coinage more acceptable to the merchants of Bral. The exchequer changes currency for a fee of 5% on the coinage exchanged. You may be surprised to learn that Bral has never bothered to mint its own currency, as the crown finds it more profitable to keep its monopoly on the exchequer.
