Owned by the renowned dwarf Frada Ironhead, his company specializes in the outfitting of ships with supplies of all descriptions. Frada’s Provisioning also acts as a large neighborhood grocery as well. Prospective starfarers are well advised to stop here before sailing. The store carries nonperishables such as salted meats, dried fruit and grains, hard tack, flour, sugar, and spices as well as necessaries like barrels, sacks, trunks, some clothing, rope, nets, and tools. A good rule of thumb when outfitting a ship for a long voyage is to allow 500 gp per 10 crewman for eight months. This may sound high, but it includes extra rope, sewing needles, hand tools, spare canvas and leather, and any of a number of other items that ships require in space. These stores would take about one ton per 10 crew members. Bare minimum stores can be purchased at half-price, but no extra materials or tools of any kind will be carried.
