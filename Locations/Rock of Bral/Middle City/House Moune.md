A relatively average example of a Bralian merchant house, the Mounes are a wealthy and powerful company on the rise. Founded by the retired adventurer Tarilia Moune, the company appears stable and strong enough to survive for several generations. House Moune derives a large portion of its profits from the import of foodstuffs, operating two farming asteroids. The steady flow of capital, generated by this safe and lucrative trade, has allowed Tarilia to purchase a couple of fast packers for exotic trade. This is a fairly typical merchant establishment in Bral, and can be used any time the players need to know the exact layout of a trading emporium or mercantile house. Tarilia herself does not live on the premises, but instead maintains a fine town- house along Park Street.
