One of the many taverns and small inns of the Middle City, the Raised Cup is a battered old hole that belongs in the dirty surrounds of the Docking Edge. Although humble in appearance, the Raised Cup caters to a special group of patrons, the Pragmatic Order of Thought. The Order has long used the Raised Cup as a secret safe house and as a meeting place. The Raised Cup offers excellent food and drink at good prices, belying its ramshackle exterior.
