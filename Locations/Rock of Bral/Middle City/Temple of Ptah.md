This powerful temple is without question the most influential and the wealthiest on the Rock. The worship of Ptah has been around as long as humans have been spelljamming, and has been present in Bral since its first days as a pirate haven. Travellers and spacefarers of all descriptions are welcome here, and will receive comfort and aid in return for small donations. The temple itself is a grand old building with a distinctly ancient cast to it. When it was built, the stones were aged to simulate weathering and the interior was filled with archeological treasures and relics. While the groundling worship of Ptah is usually found in Egyptian-like societies, the demands of the spelljamming cultures eventually won out, and Ptah’s priests began to use conventional vestments and ceremonies. A groundling priest of Ptah would find these rites to be rather shocking. The temple features a large hostelry for travellers, as well as a shrine that holds regular observances and services. A small force of warriors-templar guard the grounds. The worship of Ptah is especially popular with Seekers, and many of them belong to this congregation.
