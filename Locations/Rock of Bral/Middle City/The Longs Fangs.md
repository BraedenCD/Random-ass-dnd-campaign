One of the most notorious mercenary organizations of Wildspace, the Long Fangs are a brotherhood of chaotic and evil warriors who sell their swords to the highest bidder. They are principally interested in looting groundling realms and always ensure that generous looting clauses are included in all of their contracts. In general, only a small cadre of professional warriors is kept on the payroll between contracts; when the Long Fangs are hired, the company men will then assemble a mercenary force from whatever sources are available—including undead. There are only eight to ten salaried members of the Long Fangs on the Rock, but there are hundreds of veterans and adventurers who have served beneath their black banners. The Long Fangs have little or no discipline or even military justice, though they are well-known, far and wide, as fierce fighters.
