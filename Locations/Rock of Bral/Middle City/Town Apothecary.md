A strange old store buried in the back alleys, the Town Apothecary appears at first glance to be abandoned. It is open for business at odd intervals and features a bizarre selection of spell components, musty old tomes, various roots and herbs, and potions and elixirs of all kinds. The proprietor is an aged woman known only as Mother Greda. Her eyesight is poor, but she possesses an uncanny sense of intuition and a flawless memory. There is a 50% chance that she has any root, plant, or herb required for a spell or potion in stock. Other substances, such as mineral powders or rare animal parts, have only a 20% chance of availability. At any time, Mother Greda has 1-6 random potions for sale. Unfortunately, her potions work only 75% of the time.
