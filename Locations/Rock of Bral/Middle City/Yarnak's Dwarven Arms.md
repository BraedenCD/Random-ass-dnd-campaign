Without question, Yarnak is the finest weapon-smith and armorer in the city of Bral. His work is exceptional, and he rigidly enforces the highest standards of quality in his shop. Yarnak himself usually works on special orders, creating weapons of quality suitable for enchantment. At any given time, there is a 30% chance that a desired weapon is available as a weapon of quality, yielding a + 1 to hit or a + 1 to damage, at a cost of ten times the normal rate. If a weapon is not available, Yarnak will be happy to make it for you. Dwarven smiths work half again as fast as human ones. Armor made by Yarnak has a +4 on material saves versus any attack form and is 20% lighter than normal, but costs three times as much. He carefully measures the wearer and his armor is famous for its comfort and flexibility.
