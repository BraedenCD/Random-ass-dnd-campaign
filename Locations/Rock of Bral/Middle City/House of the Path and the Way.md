A small, humble shrine, the House is not so much a place of organized worship as a place of contemplation and enlightenment. The priests of the Path and the Way worship all deities everywhere, claiming that each and every one has his or her own place in the great Celestial Bureaucracy. Unfortunately, the priests often disagree about just what that place is. True followers of the Path and the Way gain spells as normal clerics do, but never specialize in the worship of one deity or another. They are never cut off from their patron powers, unless they enter a sphere entirely without gods. Any priest of any deity is welcome here, but they will find that the priests of the Path and the Way will try to correct their erroneous view of the multiverse by explaining where their deity fits in the Celestial Bureaucracy. The House of the Path and the Way is attended by less than a half dozen priests and priestesses, who spend most of their time in meditation or study. They do not seek new converts, confident that even the most fanatic devotee of one specific power is, in fact, correct in that worship, even if a little ignorant of the higher issues.
