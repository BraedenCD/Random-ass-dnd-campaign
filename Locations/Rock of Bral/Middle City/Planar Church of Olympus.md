Dedicated to all powers inhabiting the plane of chaotic good, the Planar Church of Olympus is one of the most powerful and popular of the planar churches. The Church venerates almost all deities of the Greek pantheon, most elvish deities, and a few of the other Olympian powers. Because of this, priests of the Church are in contact with their deities in almost any crystal sphere. The Bralian sect is on the small side, since the city only recently turned away from rampant piracy and lawlessness. The Planar Church is gain¬ ing popularity rapidly; just about anyone can find something about Olympus worthy of worship. One of the few truly benevolent organizations of the city, the priests of Olympus spend a lot of time and energy tending to the poor and the common folk of Bral. Any character with a patron deity inhabiting Olympus can expect to receive a reasonable amount of aid from the Planar Church. Note that, while planar priests have few problems with priests of individual powers, a priest who worships only one of the powers of Olympus would have a hard time accepting the worship of the entire plane and would not be inclined to turn to the Church for aid.
