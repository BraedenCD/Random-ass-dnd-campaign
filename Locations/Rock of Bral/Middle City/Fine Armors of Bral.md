Operated by a dwarven rogue named Cudrekken Goldfoot, Fine Armors of Bral is a small shop in the Dwarven District. Cudrekken is not a famous smith like Yarnak, but instead specializes in the recovery and repair of powerful weapons and damaged armor scavenged from battlefields or floating wrecks. Most of the dwarven community find Cudrekken’s lack of craftsmanship and his exploitation of honored dead to be ethically intolerable, and Cudrekken is ostracized by his own race. Fine Armors of Bral has about a half dozen suits of armor of various descriptions on hand at all times, with a 30% chance of a magical set being present. In addition, they have anywhere from 20 to 30 swords, axes, and other instruments of destruction, with a 50% chance for one to three magical items. Cudrekken is not careful with what he recovers and he has been known to sell cursed or defective items “by mistake.” Let the buyer beware. . .
