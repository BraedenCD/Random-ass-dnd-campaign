The only lock and keysmith in Bral, the gnome Dal (short for Daliddin Nimblefist) is an incredibly well-organized and foresighted businessman, for a gnome. She sells three varieties of locks: the standard, actually crafted by her apprentices (good lock, no modifier, 30 gp) the superior, made by herself (excellent lock, -4 to pick, 60 gp) and the special, a large and diabolically complex lock (superior lock, -8 to pick, 240 gp). Dal also sells picks and many special thieving supplies such as pitons, spring daggers, and other nifty devices. Dal keeps a unique lock in her store with a standing 20 gp reward to the thief who can pick it. The lock is a masterful piece with a -12 modifier to pick.
