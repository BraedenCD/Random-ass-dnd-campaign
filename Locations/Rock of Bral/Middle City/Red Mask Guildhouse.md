Fronted by a small tavern, the guildhouse for the Red Mask thieves is a series of linked cellars beneath the streets. Many patrons of the ale house above do not even suspect the establishment’s true purpose—concealing the movements of the Red Masks. The guild has managed to keep the location of their guildhouse a secret from most observers, but nothing in Bral can remain secret for long—already the Watchers and the Juggler’s Men suspect the tavern. The Red Mask is a young and violent guild fighting to carve a territory for itself. They are currently warring with the Juggler’s Men and are taking extra steps to ensure the safety of their guildhall. Patrons of the ale house will not be dis¬ turbed, but if someone were to go poking around in the back. . . Hanging in front of the tavern is the sign of the Red Bull.
