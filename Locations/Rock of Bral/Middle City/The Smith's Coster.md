A dignified brownstone building bearing the sign of the wheel-lock and shield, these are the offices of the Smith’s Coster. There are no retail facilities here per se; the company deals entirely in mass quantities and sells directly to distributors in their various markets. However, if the players ever need to equip an army rapidly, this is the place to go. The interior of the building features several spacious conference areas suitable for discussing terms with buyers or sellers. Mo arms or armor are actually kept on the premises, since the company rents large warehouses on the Docking Edge for storage.
