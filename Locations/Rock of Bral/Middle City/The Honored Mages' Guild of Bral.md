Taking the form of a slender tower of dark stone, this mystic place seems to be set apart from the city around it. The lower floor contains a reception area and a few meeting rooms; the upper floors house libraries, laboratories, and small private chambers which members may rent when conducting research on the premises. Non-mages are halted at the door by a furnace golem of some intelligence, who does not allow visitors inside without the prior permission of the mage they came to meet. Mages who are not members are permitted into the guild tower to join, if they wish. The golem is polite, but insistent, in the performance of its duties.
