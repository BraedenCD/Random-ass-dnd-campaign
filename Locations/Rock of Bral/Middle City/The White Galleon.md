This quiet inn and tavern is located off the major streets, between Armada Street and Man O’ War Street. The exterior is rather nondescript, but inside you will find a roomy, comfortable hostelry with fine service and good rates, the White Galleon is especially noteworthy because it is the home of Daargaz the Arcane. The Arcane has rented the top suite of rooms for six months now, and shows no sign of moving soon. Players actively looking for an Arcane in Bral will eventually end up at The White Galleon. Daargaz has hired a small squad of very capable bodyguards, and several clerks and messengers. The entire upper floor of the White Galleon has been absorbed by his operation. The tavern owner, a halfling named Bardilac, is quite happy with the situation: Daargaz pays him a small consideration every week for the time and the trouble of hosting the Arcane, and the merchants and adventurers seeking Arcane aid usually buy a round or two in the tavern.
