Arkan Nobrodukk is the only dwarvish member of the Noble Council. A retired adventurer, he has held his position since Cozar’s day. He is a good-hearted rogue with a long, white beard. Unlike most other nobles, he owns a comfortable home in the Dwarven District and owes most of his wealth to the subleases he has granted in the district. Arkan considers himself the voice of the dwarven community and often storms up to the palace to harangue Andru. He is 195 years old, but he has seven strong sons to carry on his house.
