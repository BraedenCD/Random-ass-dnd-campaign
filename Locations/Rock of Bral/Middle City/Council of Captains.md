Another of Frun’s architectural achievements, the Council of Captains contains a large hexagonal council chamber and two grand wings. The wings contain the offices of the Bureau of Customs and the Bureau of Trade. The Council of Captains meets once a month, but most members prefer to send their votes by proxy. The offices of the Secretary to the Council of Captains are here as well. The Secretary herself, [[Bianca Micharle]], is often found in her office. She is the head of both Bureaus, under the Council, and she has recently attracted a lot of attention by arming her customs agents and instituting a crackdown on smuggling.
