Old Balic is one of the greatest artists to ever set foot on Bral. As a young and talented swordsmith, he left his world behind to take his trade into the stars. Settling in Bral, he set up shop and began turning out some of the finest swords the pirate haven had ever seen. Balic forges weapons of quality about once every two to three months, yielding a +1 to hit or a +1 on damage. These blades are priced at 20 times normal value. Balic’s sons and apprentices turn out a fine selection of standard weapons, priced at normal value + 10%. Balic has occasionally worked with odd materials such as crystal, silver, mithril, and adamantite. If provided with the materials, he will forge a weapon for 500 gp plus 30 gp per day of forging time.
