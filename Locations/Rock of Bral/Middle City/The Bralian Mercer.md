The largest and finest of Bral’s clothing stores, the Mercer buys and sells bolts of any kind of fabric as well as finished clothing. The variety of styles and tastes on the Rock is staggering; virtually any garment listed in the Player’s Handbook is available here, with a mark up of 10-30%. Interestingly enough, most native Bralians prefer subdued, conservative, clothing to set them apart from the garish costumes of the sailors and mercenaries who throng their city. A well-dressed craftsman will usually be found with cotton breeches and a long sleeved tunic of cotton or wool that hangs to mid-thigh. Merchants and tradesmen often wear tabards over their tunics, emblazoned with the emblems of their company.
