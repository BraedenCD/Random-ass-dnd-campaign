The half-elven mage Elmandar is Bral’s most famous astronomer. He retired from adventuring some years ago and took up surveying and charting as a career. The demand for accurate starcharts is great, and Elmandar employs a small staff of cartographers and navigators who regularly take passage on tradesmen to log changes to charts in service. Elmandar’s charts sell for 300 to 800 gp each, but they are guaranteed to be as accurate as possible. In addition, the owner of an Elmandar chart can bring it back anytime for an update at no extra charge.
