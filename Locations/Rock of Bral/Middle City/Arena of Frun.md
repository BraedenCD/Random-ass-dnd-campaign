An impressive stadium of the same white granite used in the palace, the Arena seats 500 people comfortably. The facility is rarely used, but once a year a set of races, jumping contests, and mock gladiatorial combats takes place and usually at¬ tracts some interest. Most of the more blood¬ thirsty citizens of the city prefer to patronize the illegal pit fights of the Low City. The Arena is occasionally used by duelists as a neutral ground for the resolution of differences.
