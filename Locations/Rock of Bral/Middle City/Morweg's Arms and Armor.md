One of the finest weaponsmiths of the city, Morweg is a short but powerful man of about 60 years. He specializes as a gunsmith and offers a wide range of firearms. In addition, he employs several bladesmiths and armorers who turn out sabres, rapiers, daggers, main-gauches, broad¬ swords, cutlasses, bucklers, and mail of outstanding quality. Morweg’s prices are reasonable for Bral, which means that they are only 10-40% above the listed weapons prices in the Player’s Handbook.
