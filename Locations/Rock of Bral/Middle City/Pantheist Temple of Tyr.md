The Temple of Tyr is relatively young and it is likely that the worship of Tyr has spread to Bral from the Forgotten Realms, as the clergy and ceremonies seem to conform to the standards of the Torilian faith. Pantheistic priests of Tyr recognize any lawful good deity of justice or war as an avatar of their deity and often gain access to spells in many spheres that do not know Tyr by that name. As a deity of justice, Tyr is not very popular in Bral, although he is gaining in power. The priests of the temple feel obligated to take on crime and injustice wherever they find it, and this has led to several small, crusading, wars with underbarons or thieves’ guilds. On the bright side, the priests of Tyr have learned much after a couple of bloody reversals and now overcome their evil foes as often as not.
