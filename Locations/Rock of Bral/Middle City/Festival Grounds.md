Once just another residential part of the Middle City, this region was demolished by a Neogi attack which smashed Bral with a dwarven citadel. The then ruler of the Rock, Cozar's son Frun, converted the destroyed area into grounds for festivals and celebration. This part of the city is not entirely accepting of adventurers. The residential blocks trailing the Festival Grounds do not care for bands of ruffians menacing their streets, and often will summon the Magistrate’s Watch to remove intruders.
