Horses are enormously expensive on the Rock since they require large quantities of food and even larger quantities of space. Both commodities are very precious in an island city. [[Prince Andru]] maintains a small stable of 12 horses of outstanding quality. He has two well-appointed carriages that are kept in immaculate condition. The prince often chooses to go by carriage when he enters the city.
