[[Valkan Riogan]] is an extraordinary individual who has led a long and colorful career. He is a burly man in his early forties with a stern face and salt-and- pepper hair. He is a fallen paladin who took to Wildspace after a tragic love affair. He never speaks of his past. Valkan does not own five ships, but he does own and operate the largest and most successful mercenary company on the Rock, [[Valkan's Legion]]. He chooses his causes and has never sided with an evil power. His men are utterly loyal, and Valkan selects only the finest, most disciplined warriors, to join his ranks. He is one of the few who takes his [[Council of Captains|council]] duties seriously.
