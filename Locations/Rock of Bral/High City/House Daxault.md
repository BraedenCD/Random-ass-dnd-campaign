Owned by the nobleman [[Gerard Daxault]], House Daxault is one of the largest firms on the Rock. The arch-rivals of [[House Kullek]], they operate six tradesmen, two shrikeships, and two hammerships. Gerard is descended from a line of pirate captains who realized that [[Princess Ellana Cozar|Cozar]] had a good thing going, and anticipated the future growth of the city by buying up three nearby asteroids for farming purposes. Gerard does not bother to operate these himself, but instead leases them to other merchant houses, preferring to use his vessels in the lumber and commodities trade. Of course, the House collects a tidy income from the companies leasing its asteroids.
