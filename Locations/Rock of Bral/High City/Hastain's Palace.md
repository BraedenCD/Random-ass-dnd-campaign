A magnificent, rambling villa, the palace of [[Hastain]] the reigar is a constant hive of activity. The grounds are haunted by the most outrageous entertainers and artists imaginable. Many poets and painters of dubious skill and shocking subject material, find a patron in Hastain. His wealth appears inexhaustible, despite the virtual horde of sycophants who cling to him. Hastain tolerates their antics with an amused smile, but rarely joins in. The latest fad consists of painting weird designs on one’s body and leaping into [[Lake Bral]] with the greatest possible flair. Needless to say, some severe injuries have resulted from the practice of this new ‘art form’.
