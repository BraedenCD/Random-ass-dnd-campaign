This theater has been in continuous operation for over 60 years. Their lavish productions often feature magical illusions and pyrotechnical special effects. The Company usually runs two productions simultaneously, employing two separate casts. Each cast presents four to five plays during the course of the five month season. The offseason is spent in preparation for the difficult schedule of performances. The Company is run by a half-elven woman named [[Kiria Evensong]]; she acts occasionally, but spends most of her time directing and producing. Kiria is in fact the notorious Juggler, but no one knows this. Currently, the Royal Theatrical Company is presenting The Fallen, a tragedy about an elven bard who seduces a human princess; and Starward Sail, a musical farce about an inept pirate captain. Seats cost 1 gp each, but they are great shows and well worth the rate.
