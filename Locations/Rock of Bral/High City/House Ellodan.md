[[Kiade Ellodan]] is the head of the only house of elven nobles on the Rock, the House Ellodan. He is a young elf, impetuous and emotional, who manages his affairs in a haphazard manner. The wealth of the family Ellodan lies in the ownership of four fine taverns and three excellent Middle City inns. Kiade speculates in importing, as well. He is close to [[Basa Lianin]], whom he considers to be a kindred spirit among the nobility. Kiade dresses in garish colors and affects elegance.
