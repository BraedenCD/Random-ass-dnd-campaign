This area is located at the gravity plane and is reached through a series of tunnels or by a path down the cliffs from Park Street. Out of sight of the noble households above, the jettison is used to discard trash and garbage. The jettison is run by a neo-otyugh who leads a clan of a dozen or more otyughs. They quietly collect the wastes of the High City, sort through the rubbish, and discard the rest. The Jettison is an especially powerful device that easily flings up to 1,000 pounds of garbage 1,000 yards or more. The waste then drifts out along the gravity plane until it leaves the atmospheric envelope. A great number of scavvers constantly circle the drifting rubbish. The otyughs are known to turn a blind eyestalk or three to the occasional misuse of their jettison.
