The House Kullek is the most powerful and wealthy of the noble houses of Bral, owning eight tradesmen and two hammerships. The lord of Kullek is [[Morgan Kullek|Morgan]], a small, withered old man who always wears black. Morgan is a brilliant merchant and hides his formidable mind behind a sour attitude of bickering and complaint. Morgan is happy with the Rock just as it is and opposes both the Prince’s efforts to centralize, and the popular factions demanding equal representation. He has neither wife nor children and a fierce battle for the house is shaping up between his nephews. The largest and grandest of the noble estates, House Kullek rivals the [[Royal Palace|palace of the prince]] in size and grandeur. Many feel that it is a sad thing that such a lovely home is wasted on a miserly old man like Morgan Kullek. Beautiful stone sculptures adorn the wide lawn, and carefully tended apple trees flank the house. Kullek rarely receives visitors in his home, preferring to conduct business in his sizable offices in the Middle City. The grounds of his house are patrolled by crack security troops with orders to kill any intruders.
