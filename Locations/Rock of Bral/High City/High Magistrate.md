Another impressive building, the High Magistrate’s offices are little used. The High Magistrate is the aging [[High Magistrate Donobar|Lord Michel Donobar]], a dignified man whose mind is not what it once was. The High Magistrate holds the power of review over the actions of all other Magistrates, and he is also the appeal authority for the city. These days, Lord Michel is content to allow his small and capable staff to attend to all business. The High Magistrate’s building also houses the Magistrate’s Watch for the High City. About a dozen gentlemen swordsmen and four mages ranging are quartered in the building. It is now fashionable for young nobles to serve for a short time as part of this force.
