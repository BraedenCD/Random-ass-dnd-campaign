One of the finest restaurants and inns of any sphere, the Man O' War affords a spectacular view over Lake Bral. The dining room enforces a strict dress code—arms and armor are definitely forbidden. A typical dinner could run as high as 8 to 12 gp per person. The service is excellent and the food is the finest on the Rock. The Man O’ War also boasts 10 plush suites that cost anywhere from 10 to 30 gp a night. That price includes a bottle of fine wine and breakfast in the morning. An elite guard of highly paid mercenaries ensures the safety of the guests. In fact, the Man O’ War is considered safe and elegant enough for the Crown to send visiting diplomats when the palace is full.
