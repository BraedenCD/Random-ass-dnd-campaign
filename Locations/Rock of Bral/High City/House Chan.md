[[Lord Chan Fu Wi]] is the Shou emissary to Bral. He is a dignified old statesman in his late seventies who was once a formidable warrior. Chan is quite aware of the power wielded by [[Ozamata Ku Murawa|Ozamata]] and [[Kurishi Otobe|Kurishi]], but chooses to disregard them. As the Emperor’s envoy to the stars, he feels that quarreling over the leadership of the Shou community is beneath him. In some respects, he is correct. While the [[Yakuza House|Yakuza]] leaders are well known and are obeyed by the residents of [[Shou-town]], Lord Chan is the only noble Shou on the Rock. If he wished to, he could order almost anything and the Shou would follow him. Lord Chan is one of the most important Shou in Wildspace, often visited by people seeking to learn his nation’s position on numerous issues.
