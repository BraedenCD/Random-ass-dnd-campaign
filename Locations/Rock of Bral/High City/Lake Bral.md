Water is plentiful on Bral, due to its large lake. Lake Bral is abnormally clean and cold, and water is drawn from the lake by large gravity driven pumps located on the gravity plane. Public water service has been installed in most of the High City and the Middle City, but large areas of the Low City must get their water from the few central piped wells. The docks actually feature fresh water piped right up to the ship, which decreases the time and expense of watering tremendously. Water service at the docks is available for the modest fee of 1 sp per 5 tons of vessel. While water is not normally a concern for Bral, the lake itself is not eternal. After four to seven years of normal usage, the lake becomes depleted. At that point, [[Naval Base|the Bralian Navy]] has the task of lassoing one of the nearby ice asteroids and bringing it back. Outside Bral’s gravitational plane, the asteroid’s ice is broken up into manageable pieces and carefully dropped, one ton at a time, into the lake. The entire process can take up to three months, but the lake is usually filled to its topographic limits and will provide water for years to come.
