[[Isandra Calanda]] is a trim woman of 40 years with clean good looks and a warm personality. She made her money the old fashioned way—she inherited it. One of the finest hostesses on the Rock, she has spent the last 20 years squandering her family’s fortune. Her soirees are only for the elite—the swankest affairs in the city. Secretly, Isandra is a skilled burglar who defies all of the Thieves’ Guilds and steals small trinkets from the wealthy just to see if she can pull it off. She is rash and daring, and it is not known how much longer the Calanda family fortunes will hold out under her management.
