A strong and graceful structure of white granite, the Gatehouse controls access to the Royal Enclosure. The gates themselves are never shut, save during times of war. A watch of 20 Royal Guardsmen man the Gatehouse continuously. Every six hours the watch is changed in a ceremonial Changing of the Guard. Visitors are halted here and asked their business. The gates themselves are constructed of stout, iron-bound, oak.
