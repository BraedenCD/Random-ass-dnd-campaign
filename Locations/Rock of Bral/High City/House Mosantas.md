[[Tareo Mosantas]] is a slender half-elf at the height of his physical prowess, graceful and strong. He is the heir of the House Mosantas, a descendant of pirates and scoundrels. Tareo is cut from a different log though, and is known on Bral as the leader of the local chapter of the Pragmatic Order of Thought. He supervises the order’s efforts and offers refuge to any members in need of assistance. Tareo is determined to root out the slavers who operate in the city, and has been successful enough that several assassination attempts have been made on him.
