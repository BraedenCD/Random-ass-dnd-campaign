The headquarters of the Seekers, in this crystal sphere, as well as an impressive collection of books, tomes, scrolls, and manuscripts of all descriptions are in the Library of the Spheres. The city of Bral is too young to have accumulated a library of this size, but the Seekers were forced to move two of their smaller collections to Bral about 30 years ago. These two collections account for the majority of books to be found in the library. The library is open to any patron and never closes. To become a patron of the library, one need only pay 1 gp per year. Limited check out privileges are granted to patrons, usually three books at a time for no longer than a month. Honored patrons donate 50 gp per year, but gain unlimited check out privileges as well as access to the Special Collection, a room of extremely rare and valuable books. The Seekers who staff this library are happy to conduct research for patrons. Consider any researcher to be a sage with a general knowledge of any topic, requiring 3d10 days to find the answer to a general question. An additional 2d6 + 3 days are required to answer specific questions, and 2d6 above that for an exacting question. The standard research fee is 50 gp per day. Any researcher has a sage proficiency of 10 +1 d8. Magical books and scrolls are unavailable at the Library of the Spheres.
