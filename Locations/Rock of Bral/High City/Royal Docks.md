This landing area is reserved for the use of [[Prince Andru|the prince]]’s yacht, a Shrikeship called the Princess of Bral. The crew is a crack detachment of the Royal Bralian Navy, and the ship is fitted with all the creature comforts one could possibly imagine. Andru often entertains on board, and an escort of Navy warships stands by to ensure his safety. A small mosquitoship, the Sunfarer, is kept here as well and used as a launch for the prince. The Sunfarer often carries him to the Underside or to the Docking Edge, or to any of the large ships in orbit that he may need to visit.
