This majestic building is one of the principal landmarks of the city. Rising above an open floor that seats nearly 200 people, the great dome, with its pointed steeple, is one of the first things the spacefarer can pick out when approaching the Rock. Although the Noble Council has not met in three years, [[Prince Andru]] does address the citizens of the city from the podium, on those rare occasions when he speaks directly to the people. The chambers surrounding the council dome are used as the offices for the Bureau of Land Distribution and Management.
