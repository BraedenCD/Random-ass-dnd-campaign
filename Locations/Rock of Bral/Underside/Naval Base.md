Along the leading edge of the underside is an array of docks where ships of the royal navy are berthed. At any time, at least two or three ships are actively stationed at the docks, prepared to depart at a moment's notice. Just inland from the docks is a sprawling complex, the base proper, that includes a drydock area where most of the fleet is moored. The facility also contains barracks and mustering areas for captains and crews.
