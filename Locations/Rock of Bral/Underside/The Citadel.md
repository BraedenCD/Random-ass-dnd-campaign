The well-defended fortress at the center of the underside is the command center and barracks for Bral's army. The Port Tower and the Starboard Tower are connected to the Citadel by narrow, covered walkways. Three passages branch off from each tower and end at smaller towers dispersed along the edges of the Rock. All these locations enable soldiers to maintain surveillance of the asteroid's immediate environs, and they are equipped with ballistae and mangonels to defend against an invasion.
