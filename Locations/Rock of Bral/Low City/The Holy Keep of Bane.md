The Rock is not without its fair share of cults and hidden temples, and the Holy Keep of Bane is one of these lesser shrines. Founded about eight years ago by [[Halwarin]], a Zhentarim adventuring priest, the Holy Keep of Bane is housed in a run down and decrepit building, with a following of only a few dozen evil mages and warriors, if the Rock is in Realmspace in your campaign, the ternpie of Bane is somewhat more important and prosperous. Otherwise, the priests of the Holy Keep are cut off from their dark master and cannot gain spells above the 2nd-level. Halwarin is determined to bring the worship of Bane to Wildspace and has been contacted by the Tenth Pit, who view the worship of the dead god as an excellent way in which to gain secular power. Of course, Halwarin refuses to subjugate the cause of Bane to the purposes of the Tenth Pit. Most Bralians view the Holy Keep as just another collection of crazed cultists and ignore them.
