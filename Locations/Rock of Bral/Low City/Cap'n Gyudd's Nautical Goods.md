This fine business in Bral reconditions and sells nautical antiques. One of the largest such enterprises, it is run by the redoubtable dwarven veteran, [[Cap'n Gyudd]]. He carries some authentic nautical supplies, such as tools, rope, sail mending kits and such, but mostly caters to the lubbers who always fancied themselves starfarers, but never left port. Polished harpoons, lamps made from wrecks are the nautical goods that make money for the Cap’n. Gyudd has a great store of tall tales and naval lore. He loves to sit down with a real sailor (not one of the polished fops who buy his belaying pins) and trade a story or two. Gyudd captained a pirate ship a few decades ago and can be a valuable source of information, if the players don’t mind the occasional long winded sea story.
