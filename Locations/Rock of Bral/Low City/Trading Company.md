A staunchly neutral mercenary organization which provides both soldiers and weapons to various conflicts. The Trading Company, as a matter of ethical policy, only aids one side of a struggle. They maintain a small number of ships, preferring to lease additional vessels as they are needed. The Trading Company keeps a large warehouse on Bral, stockpiling weapons of all descriptions for export to war zones. In addition, a small cadre of trained mercenaries is kept on hand for recruiting and training. If a war were to occur on a world within Bral’s crystal sphere, the merchants would start hoarding weapons and hiring ships while the mercenary commanders would begin a massive recruiting drive. The Senior Agent for the Trading Company in Bral is the half-elf [[Talosa Baniasan]]. He prefers to handle the hardware and let the experienced soldiers take care of the recruiting and training.
