More properly known as the Eighteenth Detached, Light Dismounted Horse, Reinforced, of (Brevet) Sergeant-Major [[Tomogan Shaul Agamour]], this is a platoon of giff mercenaries which makes its home on Bral. A force of nearly 70 professional soldiers, Agamour’s platoon has served with distinction for many years. The giff are expensive to hire, but usually worth the price. Once on the payroll, they embrace almost any cause with dedication and pride. Sergeant-Major Agamour is an aging giff who hides a keen mind (for a giff) behind stuffy formality and overbearing pompousness.
