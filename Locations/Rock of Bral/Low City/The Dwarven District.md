One of the city’s largest and most well-defined barrios, the Dwarven District is actually one of the more prosperous areas in the Low City. The dwarves are, on the whole, a skilled and hard working race, and their presence on the Rock dates back to the first pirate havens. While dwarves are by nature a taciturn and clannish folk, living in such close proximity to other races has made the Bralian natives far more tolerant of outsiders than their groundling kinsmen. It is not uncommon for the alleys and streets to be crowded with non-dwarves seeking goods of matchless dwarven quality and craftsmanship. The dwarves generally police themselves, and the [[Low Magistrate|Magistrate’s Watch]] is rarely called into the District. Troublemakers are set upon by large numbers of dwarven veterans and rarely heard from again
