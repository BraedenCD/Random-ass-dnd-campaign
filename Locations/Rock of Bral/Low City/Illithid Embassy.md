Actually comprising a complex of several buildings with covered walkways and boarded windows, the illithid embassy is a quiet, brooding building which radiates menace. Very few Bralians ever find a reason to set foot in here, and are quite happy to keep it that way. Several dozen mind flayers live in the Low City, and their relationship with the official embassy is unclear—they seem to be living independently of their native lands, but the ambassador Ishathrandra appears to command their respect and obedience. In any event, very few beings, of any race, cross the illithids and live to tell the tale. Rumors persist of a large cavern or underground facility beneath the mind flayer compound, where human slaves are kept as cattle for the mind flayers’ unspeakable appetites.
