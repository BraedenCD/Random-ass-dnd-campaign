Easily the busiest of the three magistrates, the Low Magistrate has a small staff of watch commanders who act as sub-magistrates and refer only the truly heinous felonies to [[Low Magistrate|the Magistrate himself]]. The building is rather old and run down, with overcrowded cells and a dingy barracks for the Magistrate’s Watch. The place is a pandemonium of shouting, arguing creatures of a dozen races and grim guardsmen trying to sort out who stabbed whom, and when. The Low Magistrate’s Watch is a heavily armed force of around 50 tough fighters, armored in banded mail with halberds, short swords, targes, and light crossbows. In addition, half a dozen mages are available to aid in the apprehension of dangerous criminals. The Low Magistrate’s Watch patrols the streets at random intervals, but it is more likely that they will stumble across a felon in the act while on their way to apprehend someone else.
