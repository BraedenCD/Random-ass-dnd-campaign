A fairly typical boarding house of the Low City, the Red House is owned and operated by a stout, gnomish matron, by the name of [[Gertreid]]. Her husband is a retired pirate who still tinkers with variations on the heavy crossbow. The Red House is a large, decrepit building that is surprisingly comfortable and well-kept on the inside. Gertreid cooks three meals a day, and charges her tenants at the end of the month based on the number of meals they sat down to eat—figured at 2 sp per three meals. Rooms let for 5 gp per month. The Red House has a total of 12 rooms, three of which are doubles and occupied by families. The rooms are comfortable and clean, and adventurers passing through Bral could do far worse than to end up at Gertreid’s Red House.
