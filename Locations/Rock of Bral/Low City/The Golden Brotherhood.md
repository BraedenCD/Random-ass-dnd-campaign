Some Bralians view this club as an anachronism, a relic of days-gone-by. The Golden Brotherhood is a loose organization of privateers and mercenaries, open to any who fight for gold and glory. This building contains a fine tavern, a roomy inn, a small hall, and a set of offices. The Golden Brotherhood is the direct descendant of the Black Brotherhood, a piratical organization founded by old Captain Bral himself. Many people do not bother to distinguish between the two groups and consider a member of the Golden Brotherhood the next best thing to a declared pirate. Members usually receive a tattoo of a serpent-twined dagger on the left forearm. Within the organization any man can challenge another for rank or belongings. The weapons are usually knives, with the off-hands of the combatants tethered by a foot long length of cord. These duels can occur even between defeated prisoners and members of a victorious boarding party; more than one captain won his command after losing his ship and then challenging the fellow who had just beaten him. On Bral, about half the sailors or marines on any given privateer belong to the Golden Brotherhood. A pirate vessel, encountered in the area, will include 20-50% (d4 + 1) Golden Brothers, and a Bralian merchantman or naval vessel about 5- 30% (5d6). The Golden Brotherhood has no agenda and no organization, beyond providing a common ground for buccaneers and brigands of all kinds.
