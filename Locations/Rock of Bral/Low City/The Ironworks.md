One of the largest casting and cold forge facilities known in any sphere, the Ironworks of Bral are operated by the Forgemen. The Forgemen are an ironworkers guild, a sister organization to the Shipwrights’. They produce iron plate and castings for use in hull construction and repair. The Ironworks does no smelting, but instead, buys refined ore. Their forges are powered by magical fires which are periodically renewed by members of the Mages’ Guild. Prices for ship repair and construction include the cost of iron plate and fittings.
