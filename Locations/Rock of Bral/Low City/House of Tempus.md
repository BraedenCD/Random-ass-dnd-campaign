Another of the small sects struggling to flourish in Bral, the House of Tempus is dedicated to the lord of battle and glorious war. The worship of Tempus is very new on Bral, dating back only 11 years. The current commanding priest, Taval Hammerfist, brought the worship of Tempus to Bral from the Forgotten Realms. If you have placed the Rock in Realmspace, the priests of Tempus have full access to their spells, if not, it is fairly likely that this particular branch of the temple is becoming a polyglot faith that will venerate any deity of battle, such as Ares, Tyr, or even Thor. The House of Tempus is growing in popularity, as more and more mercenaries and fighting men and women are drawn into the congregation. It is possible that the worship of Tempus in many spheres could begin from here.
