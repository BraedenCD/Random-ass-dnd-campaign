Perhaps one of the four or five dirtiest and most dangerous taverns in Bral, the Rockrat is a ramshackle old building decorated with battered old nautical gear. Catering to the cheapest sailors and tradesmen calling at Bral, the Rockrat also enjoys a fair amount of local flavor—it is a favorite among the giff, for example. The Rockrat’s bouncer is a famous ogre named [[Grinder]], who is actually a rather decent fellow (for an ogre). No one is allowed in with weapons, but the bare knuckled brawls that occur from time to time are sufficiently dangerous even without arms. The tavern’s bad reputation and questionable clientele has led to its general boycott by decent and honest folk—which makes it a fine place for meeting rogues and thieves. A draft of ale at the Rockrat costs 5 cp, and a meal of disappointing quality runs about 2 sp.
