These are the offices and barracks of the mercenary company known as the Dwarven Boarding Company. They are specialists in ship-to-ship combat and are often sought after as marines, by both merchants and privateers. The leader of the company is a grim old veteran by the name of [[Threndur Icehewer]]. His mercenaries have several large forges and armories in the immediate vicinity and maintain their own armor.
