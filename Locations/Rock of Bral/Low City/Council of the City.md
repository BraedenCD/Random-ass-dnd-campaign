Housed in an old, but dignified building, the Council of the City is a relatively meaningless body that tends to rubber stamp the prince’s edicts with little debate. Each major guild or race is represented, as well as territorial areas of the city. There are dwarven, elven, and giff delegates as well as shipwright, merchant, and noble representatives. Although the Council has the power to overturn the prince’s laws, the current membership has been appointed, in its entirety, by [[Prince Andru]] or by Prince Frun, and the appointment is for life. The Council is often called upon to resolve disputes between communities or organizations. For example, if the halflings complain that the giff have been blowing things up again, the council would resolve the matter with a debate and an injunction to the giff not to blow things up. Of course, the giff disregard the council’s will, since there is no means by which the council can enforce its resolutions, and promptly begin to blow things up again. Many citizens feel a day at the Council of the City beats a day at the theatre for entertainment value.
