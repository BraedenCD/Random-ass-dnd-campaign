A strong old man, [[Strombardi]] is an artistic carver of wood. He has carved and painted dozens of fine figureheads in his time, and also prepares decorative work for use in new buildings; staircases, newels, and eaves in particular. Strombardi has a couple of talented young apprentices to whom he is teaching his art, and it seems likely that they will continue on in his footsteps, in time.
