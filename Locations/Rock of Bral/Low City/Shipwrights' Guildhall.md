The Guildhall is nearly 100 feet tall and was constructed from a grounded cuttle command ship. Most of the tentacles have been removed and replaced with permanent structural supports, and the ship has served well for 60 years or more. The towering, curved shell is one of the unique features of Bral’s Low City. Inside the Guildhall are meeting halls, taverns, spare rooms, and the business offices of the guild. Captains wishing to build and commission a new vessel will meet with guild representatives here to agree on price, method of payment, delivery times, and, most importantly, what is to be included with the ship. Captains having ships repaired will also meet extensively with naval architects and shipwrights to discuss progress and any problems that may arise. Most customers with a basis for comparison, consider the shipyards of the Rock to be among the best in the Known Spheres. The shipwrights are fiercely proud of their work and reputation. They would never allow a shoddy piece of workmanship to leave their yards.
