A very unusual firm with a small, ill kept office, Xenotermination consists of about a dozen proven veterans and battle-mages. The leader of the company, [[Clriksedda]], will occasionally take on extra hands for a big assignment, but she views anyone beyond her own picked crew as expendable and is actually rather surprised when a temporary survives an assignment. Xenotermination pays very well, but its employ is perhaps the most dangerous occupation in all Wildspace. Clriksedda and her men hunt down and remove dangerous Wildspace creatures, endangering the profit margins of large trading companies, such as a witchlight marauder preying on an asteroid base or a radiant dragon threatening a space lane. At first glance, they don’t look like much, simply a bunch of scarred old veterans with attitudes, lounging around the run down office. But when Xenotermination goes into action, they work together with a speed and precision that is legendary. Clriksedda generally charges 100 gp per man, per day, plus a bounty on the creatures to be hunted and guaranteed reimbursement for healing or burial expenses.
