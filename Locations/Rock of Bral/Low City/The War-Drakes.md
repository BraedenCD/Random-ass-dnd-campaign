The War-Drakes are privateers and one of the most successful fleets-for-hire in all the Known Spheres. This elegant brownstone building is their headquarters and main office. The War-Drakes consist of four ships: a hammership, two squid-ships, and a shrikeship. Unlike most privateers, they do not just settle for a letter of marque, but demand mercenary salaries as well. The War-Drakes are led by the rogue elven captain [[Celestia Silverfist]]. She is known to have served for many years with the elven armada, but now commands this small flotilla of freebooters. The War-Drakes seek out wars between star-faring powers and offer to join a side—for a price: a letter of marque and a sum of gold. The four ships then function as a pirate flotilla, cooperating in coordinated attacks of towns and convoys. When they are between jobs, they practice relentlessly, perfecting their cooperative tactics. They have destroyed more than one squadron sent to halt their maraudings. Hiring the War-Drakes is very expensive, but many governments consider contracting privateers to be cheaper than buying and maintaining a fleet. The War-Drakes are always looking for good fighters and skilled mages and priests.
