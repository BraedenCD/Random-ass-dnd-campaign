Small and nondescript, this ramshackle old building seems to leer and lean drunkenly with age. One of the first warehouses of the city, it was converted into a boarding house in later years. When that was abandoned, the yakuza moved in and renovated the structure for their own purposes. At first glance it appears to have become a warehouse again, but inside there are locked doors and watchful guards. The yakuza are growing stronger every day, as [[Shou-Town]] continues to grow, and have already fought bitter wars to extend their territory. Already the greater part of the Low City is under their sway, and even now they plan to drive the halflings out of business. Most people would walk right past this building without suspecting that it concealed the house of the yakuza. Should someone be so rash as to attempt to enter by force or stealth, they will be dealing with several dozen of the most dangerous rogues of Bral.
