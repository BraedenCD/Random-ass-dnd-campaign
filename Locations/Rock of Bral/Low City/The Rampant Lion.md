The Rampant Lion is one of the better taverns and inns of Low City. It is hidden in one of the alleyways surrounding the [[Lesser Market]], and caters to the itinerant spacefarer, specializing in taking rooms in advance; that way, a celebrating sailor is guaranteed to have a place to go when he spends what gold he has left. Although the Rampant Lion is clean and cheap, it is avoided by native Bralians. Guests at the inn have an unnerving tendency to disappear, never to be seen again. The owner, a portly human hostler named [[Warris]], claims that the vanished guests have merely shipped out again in the early hours. Some people claim that the site of the Rampant Lion is above a secret slave pit where drunken sailors are sold to the mind flayers as cattle. Of course, these wild rumors are unsubstantiated.
