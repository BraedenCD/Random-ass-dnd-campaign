One of the many fine canvasworkers of Bral, the company known as the Royal Sailmakers purchased a Royal Endorsement some years ago in order to gain their trademark. They are the largest sailmakers in Bral and the chief outfitters for new vessels built by the Shipwright’s Guild. Rigging costs 100 gp per ton of ship when the vessel is first built, but this is generally figured into the contract and is not directly paid by the purchaser. Replacement sails, lines, and tackle cost half as much if a ship is to be refitted. Most ships carry at least one spare of every sail they have, and often two or three spares of sails that are subject to frequent damage. Single sails vary widely in price, depending on whether or not it is a standard cut or size, what special attachment points it may have, and decorations or embroidery. A safe average might be 100 to 1000 gp to replace a sail lost in battle or storm.
