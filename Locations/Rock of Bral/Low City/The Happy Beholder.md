The Happy Beholder is owned by none other than [[Large Luigi]], the famous beholder and tavern keeper. Luigi is an extremely wise and knowledgeable beholder who is one of the very few members of his race to understand the beholder destiny—to learn and to teach. Luigi is a civic minded and well-liked citizen of Bral, and spends most of his time listening to the rumors of far spheres and great adventures. Very few people realize that Luigi’s knowledge is godlike in its scope—that he is a vision of the potential of the beholder race. He has, at one time, known everything there is to know about anything in the entire multiverse. Chances are good that he realizes that all of existence is contained within the imaginations of a weird class of beings beyond gods who call themselves roleplayers. Luigi is more than happy to share information with anyone who cares to seek the answers from him, but he has an infuriating tendency to withhold vital knowledge. He cannot reveal knowledge that would upset the balance of the cosmos and on many occasions that could depend on something as simple as an adventurer knowing where to find a fabled ruin or a reclusive hermit. All he asks in return is a story or song for his many patrons. The Happy Beholder is rarely troubled by bullies or hoodlums. Large Luigi’s powerful magical abilities quickly put an end to trouble virtually before it starts.
