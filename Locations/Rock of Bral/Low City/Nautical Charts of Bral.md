A large and prosperous business, Nautical Charts of Bral offers a wide range ofstarcharts and navigation essentials such as instruments and tables of precession. To outfit a ship with a basic selection of charts for nearby spheres and the bare bones of navigational gear costs about 4000 to 7000 gp (d4+ 3). This would include from 10 to 15 charts, a set of books containing the tables of precession, an astrolabe (a mechanical device that can be adjusted to mimic a crystal sphere), sextants, dividers, parallel rulers, and similar paraphernalia. Nautical Charts of Bral is run by a young, grey elf who was once a pupil of Elmandar’s. [[Teledir Sunstrider]] is a radical innovator in the field of navigation and has already introduced several new techniques.
