Similar in design and function to the [[Trailing Jettison]], this device serves the Low City and parts of the Middle City. It is operated by a small band of otyughs who scour the city for rubbish to bring to the jettison and root through. Occasionally their street sweeping removes a few drunkards and beggars as well, but nobody complains. A clever, sarcastic neo-otyugh leads the band and directs their actions. Ships approaching the docks are sometimes targeted and fired on with loads of stinking ordure, and many of Bral’s rogues love to place bets on whether or not the vessel can avoid the fetid missiles.
