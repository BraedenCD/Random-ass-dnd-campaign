This isolated warehouse is full of silk, cotton, and spices. However, the careful observer might note that the inventory never changes. This is because the real trade of [[House Eirenfezt]] is in slaves, who are kept in secret pens beneath the warehouse and beneath the house offices in the city. Ships, flying the Eirenfezt flag, sail out to meet Chainmen slavers and transfer slaves and goods in some hidden location. They then repaint the ship and bring it back into port, making it appear that it is different from the ship which just left. Again, a careful observer would notice that the crew has not changed. Of course, this is Bral, and careful observers rarely publicize their findings. Truly ignorant buyers have occasionally bought substantial quantities of Eirenfezt’s bogus goods, forcing the Chainmen to rapidly restock the warehouse in order to avoid suspicion.
