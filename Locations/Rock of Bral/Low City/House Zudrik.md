[[Mordreggan Zudrik]] is a scarred dwarven veteran who founded a mining house some 45 years ago. House Zudrik specializes in asteroid mining, seeking out high grade ores with specialized tradesmen and survey equipment, and then operating short-lived mines. The house has grown into a powerful company employing more than 300 dwarves, mercenary guards, and spelljammers. Zudrik operates two survey ships and three whaleships, modified for dwarven use and fitted out as portable mining camps with living quarters, kitchens, and refinement facilities on board. When an asteroid mine is established, the camp is set up and the empty space on the whaleship is converted to bulk ore stowage. Mordreggan himself is considered to be one of the patriarchs of the dwarven community.
