Perhaps the single most mysterious structure on Bral, this was an abandoned warehouse until 11 years ago, when the Mercane decided to establish a permanent presence in Bral. Working through middlemen and agents, the Mercane purchased the building from the Crown for an exorbitant sum and proceeded to completely remodel it. An elite force of skilled and loyal mercenaries guard the building, posting sentries on each wall and on the roof, but even they have never been inside. Somehow, the Mercane make major helms, or receive them from smuggled cargo, because this is where purchasers are taken when the new helm is carried out. There is some speculation that a gate or an extradimensional doorway is hidden inside the agency, and that the Mercane homelands lie beyond—no one knows for sure.
