An armorer who specializes in making heavy weapons, [[Ilian Houwe]] is human, a tall and gaunt woman of about 55; a very serious person who rarely smiles. She is very demanding of the half dozen journeymen and apprentices she employs, and her excellent work reflects this. Houwe’s rents a couple of buildings in the vicinity and in them she occasionally has on hand a couple of ballistae or light catapults which can be sold off the shelf. Otherwise, most of her work is already committed by order. Ilian Houwe obtained an exclusive contract recently to provide armaments to ships constructed in the yards. Given a month or two for completion, Ilian’s great skill and careful craftsmanship can result in heavy weapons with a + 1. These weapons are finely balanced and made from more expensive materials than normal, and are three times as expensive as a regular piece.
