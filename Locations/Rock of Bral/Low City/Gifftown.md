The giff do not come close to filling this block of the Low City, but they are easily the dominant race of this neighborhood, and certainly its most remarkable feature. The giff have but one occupation—soldiering. Every household features a sign proclaiming the availability of its occupants for military duty, and few giff remain between jobs for very long. The rest of the houses and stores in this barrio belong to the armorers, smiths, and weaponeers who make a living keeping the giff in business.
