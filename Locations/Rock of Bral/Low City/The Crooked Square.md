The favored ale house of Bral's large and powerful Shipwrights' Guild, this tavern is a rowdy place with frequent good natured brawls and service until the break of day. Its emblem is a carpenter's square with the tee set askew. Most of the shipwrights are normal human artisans, but there are a few unusual types among them, including a couple of giants and several thieves and guild thugs. Those not shipwrights, drinking in here, have an excellent chance of being drawn into a fight, but for the most part, the brawlers remain unarmed.
