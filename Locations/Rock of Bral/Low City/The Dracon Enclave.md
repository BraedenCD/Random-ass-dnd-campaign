A new building of distinct draconian architecture, the Enclave was raised as a kind of community center and embassy. It acts as a consulate, offering shelter and aid to any dracon passing through Bral, as well as a diplomatic mission. The old kaba, [[Stakahlla]], is the senior dracon representative on the Rock, and is empowered to speak on behalf of all draconkind. Realistically, he would not presume to do so unless the matter was both grave and urgently required dracon action. Messages would then be sent to the largest dracon worlds advising the leaders of what had been done.
