The smallest and newest of the barrios, Dracon-Town consists of only 20 or so extended families in the area immediately surrounding the Dracon enclave. Dracons do not live anywhere else in the city since their affinity for their own kind will not allow them to live anywhere but in the company of their own race. Dracons are relatively quiet and maintain a fair amount of calm in their immediate vicinity. Few people come here looking for trouble. All of the dracons consider themselves to be members of the same extended herd, led by the powerful kaba called [[Stakahlla]]. He considers it imperative to keep the dracons at a dignified distance from the disorderly chaos of the Rock, and guards his herd with wisdom and compassion.
