A stately building in the Shou style, the Embassy seems almost jarringly out-of-place on Bral's docking edge. Golden dragons crouch at the cornices and snarling bronze foo beasts guard the doors. Inside, the embassy is composed of many small but elegant chambers, where the ambassador receives his visitors. [[Lord Chan Fu Wi]] is the current emissary of Shou to the Rock, and is one of the most important Shou in Wildspace. He is in direct contact with the Emperor’s court through the aid of a wu jen assistant. Lord Chan does not seem to care about matters so base as yakuza or strong-arming the Shou community of Bral; he is far too busy representing his government in space. His restraint and quiet manner conceal the vast scope of powers of policy and diplomacy with which he is invested. If Lord Chan had good cause, he could hurl the Shou spacefaring navy into a war and expect the court to back him up. He also holds the power of high justice, in the Emperor s name, and at a word, could have [[Ozamata Ku Murawa]] taken into the street and decapitated. He simply thinks that these things are undignified and prefers not to exert his power.
