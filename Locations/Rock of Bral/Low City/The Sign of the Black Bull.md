Well-known as the favored tavern of mercenaries and assassins, this is actually a quiet ale house of quality. A distinctly martial decor includes proud heraldic arms on the walls and banners hung from the ceiling. The Black Bull attracts many professional soldiers and retired veterans who like to come here and reminisce of past battles. Despite the militant character of the clientele, the Black Bull is a very subdued establishment. People who pick fights in here are killed, not just bludgeoned or bruised.
