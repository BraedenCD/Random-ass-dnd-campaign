A closely knit community that seems to spread a little farther every day, Shou-Town is composed of several hundred Shou who have emigrated to Wildspace. Most were fleeing strife at home, signing on with the occasional spelljammer calling in Shou Lung, and working for passage for themselves and their families. It did not take long for the cultural patterns of Shou to reestablish themselves, and in no time at all the yakuza were again running things. Unlike the realm of Shou Lung they left, there is no nobility or class of warriors in the Shou-Town of Bral. Almost without exception, the Shou are craftsmen and artisans, pursuing their trades. A walk through Shou-Town is a relatively noisy affair, with industry and activity on all sides. In the shadows, the tattooed [[Yakuza House|yakuza]] eye visitors warily, watching over their selected territories.
