One of the oldest and most respectable of the small shrines of Bral, the Temple of Odin was founded more than 50 years ago. A group of viking spacefarers and their spelljamming priest were swept to the Rock by a odd space storm, and they were unable to find their way home. The warriors eventually took wives and started families, forming a small nordic community that was eventually reabsorbed by cosmopolitan Bral. In the meantime, the temple actually began to attract a few scattered worshippers besides the vikings and their families. The current priest may or may not be in contact with Odin, depending on where the DM wishes to place Bral. Even if the All-father is not known in Bral’s sphere, he will be soon, if the congregation grows much larger. Its numbers are now about 100.
