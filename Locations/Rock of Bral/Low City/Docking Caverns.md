A series of natural caverns, widened and smooth floored for use as cargo handling areas, the docking caverns can only accommodate the smallest of vessels—a wingspan of 50' or less is required to actually pass within. The caverns are far more important as an area in which to unload ships and store cargo while lift service is arranged. The caverns feature a set of cargo lifts that pass through shafts in the Rock to the Topside. The lifts are simply wooden platforms that ride on vertical tracks, lifted by stout cables. Each lift emerges in one of the warehouses along the Docking Edge. Some of these shafts may be rented from the owner of the warehouse for private use, but most merchants who do not own one find it cheaper to hire porters to carry goods topside. The caverns also have a small business district where cargoes are traded right on the docks and vendors sell ale and food to the many sailors and longshoremen there.
