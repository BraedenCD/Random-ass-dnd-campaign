Owned and operated by the legendary gunsmith [[Adelphus Krunz]], the Kanonwerks is one of the few plants which make bombards. Each cannon is lovingly crafted with skill and expertise, decorated with beautiful scrollwork and detailed with silver or gold etching, and then taken to the Edge and fired dozens of times. The giff love this, and all work stops for days whenever Adelphus is testing a new design or trying new ammunition types. Adelphus is pioneering new casting techniques, trying to develop a simple process for mass producing cheap, but safe, cannon. So far he has been unsuccessful, since the only manufacturing technique that can produce a barrel of the required strength involves numerous heating and cooling cycles, as steel reinforcing bands are shrunk on to the cast iron barrel. Fortunately, the casting technology he needs is still decades away. Adelphus works only on order and requires two to four months to make a bombard. He never has extra pieces laying around which can be sold off the shelf.
