A small and out of the way shrine, this building is dedicated to the worship of Gond, a deity of the Forgotten Realms. Three gnomish priests of the Wonderbringer brought Gond's worship to Wildspace, and the deity is a favorite with the local gnomish community. Gnomes bring their own special perspective to Gond's temple, and the building is filled with strange and irritating inventions of all kinds. A small number of human worshippers of Gond attend ceremonies here as well, but Gond is not yet well-known in Wildspace, and with any luck the gnomes will not be able to change that for a while. A member of Gond’s clergy from Toril would find this temple alarming and heretical, as the gnomish priests have chosen to depict Gond as an exceptionally short and gnarled old gnome. Worse yet, the image is articulated and can get up to collect its own offerings.
