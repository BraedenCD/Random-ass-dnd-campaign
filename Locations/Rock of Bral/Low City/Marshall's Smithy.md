A small but prosperous blacksmith, [[Marshall]] is a tall, gaunt young man. He specializes in metal fittings for ships, including bolts, nails, iron plates and joining pieces. He also forges hammerheads, axeheads, and adze for outfitting vessels and for sale to the shipwrights of the city. Marshall occasionally forges weapons such as arrowheads or war axes, but he derives his principal income from tools and nails.
