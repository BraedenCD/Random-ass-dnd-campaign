A small and quiet neighborhood that climbs down the slope of the Rock, the Burrows are the barrio of the halflings. Visitors of other races are relatively scarce, but do occasionally patronize the fine restaurants and taverns of the Burrows. The broad hillside here is perfect for halfling dwellings, and almost every home is a comfortable burrow with several windows looking out over the Edge. Most halflings, thieves included, prefer to keep their business out of their homes and own or rent buildings in the Low and Middle Cities. With few shops or merchants in the Burrows to attract visitors, the halflings do not see the kinds of crowds that are common in the Dwarven District and are likely to react poorly to armed people wandering around without looking like they’re going anywhere. All the halflings on the Rock are under the protection of the Underbaron [[Meredin Sandyfoot]], and acts of intimidation or violence against the small folk will not go unpunished.
