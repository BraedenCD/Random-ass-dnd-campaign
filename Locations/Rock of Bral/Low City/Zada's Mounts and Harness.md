Occupying a small group of buildings and a tiny patch of open ground by the Edge, Zada’s Mounts is operated by the famous [[Zada Doshioskov]]. Zada is a small human of middle years dressed in preposterous finery. His business is the trade of mounts of any descriptions. He is the only horse trader on the Rock, and his prices reflect this monopoly. Zada’s animals are, without exception, poorly bred sickly nags, with broken spirits and vicious natures. It is frankly amazing that he manages to find, in any single beast, so many damning faults. At any given time he has 1d10 horses, 1d6 dogs, 1d4-1 camels, 2d6 mules or asses, and 1d3-1l yaks. As a general rule, the prices for any animal are three times higher than those listed in the Player’s Handbook, and the animals are of poor quality. On the bright side, Zada cannot tell a prized charger from a dying nag, and on occasion a fine animal comes into his possession. He will part with one of these excellent mounts for the same price. Also, Zada occasionally acquires a bizarre animal, such as a lion, a dinosaur, a pegasus, or griffon. Zada sells harness and tack at the listed prices.
