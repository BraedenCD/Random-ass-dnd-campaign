Owned by the famous lizardman warrior [[Saakharr]], this armory caters to a nonhuman clientele seeking good armor. Fine arms and mail tailored to lizardmen, ogres, gift, dracons, grommans, hadozee, and other nonhuman races may be found here. In general, armor made to fit one of these races is two to five times more expensive than similar armor made for a human and weighs 50-100% more than the human equivalent. Lizardmen need extra protection for their tails and they are fond of strapping a couple of nasty spikes to the tip. Ogres need oddly cut, oversize pieces. Dracons require a combination of barding and regular armor. There is a base 50% chance that a suit of chainmail or banded mail is on hand that can be fitted to the nonhuman purchaser. If it is not available, measurements will be taken and a new set made for the purchaser. This will take four to eight weeks, but the service does not increase the price.
